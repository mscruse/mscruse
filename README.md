<h3>ðŸ‘‹  Hey i'm Michael.</h3>
<p>I co-own a digital agency called <a href="https://www.mity.com.au" target="_blank">Mity Digital</a> and am based in Melbourne, Australia.</p>
<p>Up until recently Joomla was my main focus and platform of choice for building websites, but lately I have been getting into Statamic, and loving it.</p>
<p>I also work with Shopify creating custom themes for our clients.</p>
<p>You contact me over at <a href="https://www.mity.com.au" target="_blank">Mity</a> if you're looking to work together, or check out my <a href="https://www.michaelscruse.com" target="_blank">personal website</a> where you'll find random ramblings.</p>
